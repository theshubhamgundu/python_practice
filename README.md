## üßÆ Project Overview

### 1. Age Calculator
- Uses the `datetime` module to compute age accurately.
- Displays output dynamically with Streamlit.
- Simple, user-friendly interface.

### 2. Mini Programs - 1
Includes:
- Area of a Circle calculation  
- Vowel and Consonant counting  
- Subtracting 5 from numbers divisible by 5  
- Even and Odd index separation  
- Summation of indices (even/odd)  
- Filtering cities by first letter or numerical value  

### 3. Mini Programs - 2
Continuation of Python logical exercises focusing on:
- String manipulation  
- List processing  
- Loop and conditional logic  
- Basic mathematical computations  

### 4. NumPy Practice / Python Concepts
- Demonstrates **NumPy arrays** and their properties.  
- Shows usage of various data types: `int8`, `int16`, `float32`, `complex64`, `bool`, and more.  
- Interactive visualization of array structures and attributes.  

### 5. Petrol Price Calculator
- Takes petrol price per liter and liters as input.  
- Calculates total amount payable.  
- Demonstrates Streamlit input/output widgets and arithmetic logic.
